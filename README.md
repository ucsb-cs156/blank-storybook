# blank-storybook
A blank storybook, in CS156 house style (in frontend directory)

This repo contains a minimal React frontend in CS156 house style:
* Frontend is in a directory called `frontend`, and was created using:
  
  ```
  npx create-react-app frontend
  ```
* Then we added storybook using 
  ```
  npx storybook@latest init
  ```

We then made minimal changes to set up the repo for access to Chromatics online tools for Storybook, 
including CI/CD support using Github Actions.
